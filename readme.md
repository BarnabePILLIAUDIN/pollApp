# Pollapp

This a project I have done on my free time.

## What you can do in Pollapp

You can create your account, create polls and answer to it.You can see all your polls and the results in your "myAccount" page.

## How to run

Create a .env file with 3 variables:

- DBPATH with the path of your DB (I used a mongo db database).
- PORT with the port you want the app to listen on.
- JWT-SECRET a string for the json web tokens.
  Then run npm i in your terminal and it will work.
